h1. Hobbit vs. Giant: An Example of Using Closures in Javascript

Your village is being threatened by an evil, ugly giant! The only way to save your village is with... Javascript!

This small Javascript example is meant to show how you could use closures. To see the example in action, open "index.html" in a browser on your local machine and click the "Attack the giant!" button.

The javascript contains a lot of comments which hopefully explain everything that's going on.
